			<h2 class="">Who are we?</h2>
			<p>AssangeDAO is a multilingual cross-border collective governed by holders of the $JUSTICE token. We are united in our mission to Free Julian Assange. AssangeDAO has completed it's first objective in raising millions of dollars for Julian Assange's legal campaign and now continues forward with it's mission. We will initiate and support projects that can help directly or indirectly bring about Julian Assange's freedom and support causes that he cares about such as Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Information and Whistleblowing.</p>

			<h3 class="mb-4">Background</h3>
			<p><b>The AssangeDAO is dedicated to restoring Assange's freedom.</b></p>
			<p>The DAO started to mobilize in a Telegram group on December 10th, 2021, the day that the U.S. government won its appeal of a British court ruling that barred Assange’s extradition to the US. If extradited to the United States, Assange faces 175 years in prison for publishing truthful information.</p>
			<p>Shortly after the Telegram group was formed, Assange’s brother Gabriel Shipton joined. He informed us that an NFT collaboration with Assange was in progress which was going to be auctioned to raise funds for his campaign.</p>
			<p>Inspired by the FreeRossDAO (which raised $12 million to free Ross Ulbricht), the AssangeDAO successfully raised $55 Million to bid on the NFT. By building an Assange solidarity network we move to send a powerful signal that the time of passivity is over. A new era of the cypherpunk movement has begun.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-md-6 text-left">
			<h3 class="mb-0">Censored NFT Collection:</h3>
			<h3 class="mb-4 primary">Assange x Pak</h3>
			<p><a href="https://censored.art">Censored</a> is an NFT collection in collaboration with Assange and renowned digital artist Pak that was auctioned on February 7th, 2022. The collection consists of a 1/1 dynamic NFT and a dynamic open edition in which anyone was able to participate. The DAO won the auction of the 1/1 dynamic NFT but did not participate in the open edition.</p>
			<p>AssangeDAO raised over $55 million worth of ETH to purchase the 1/1 dynamic NFT. The dynamic NFT was minted using manifold.xyz smart contracts and was auctioned by Pak. Proceeds raised from the NFT sale were donated by Pak in their entirety to Assange's legal defense fund and Free Assange campaign efforts by way of Wau Holland Foundation, a longstanding nonprofit organization with a strong history of assisting Assange. We aimed to form a dedicated community and network that can aid in the fight for the liberation of Assange, and so we have.</p>

				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3 class="mb-4">How it works</h3>
			<p>The DAO is fully community led. Following the footsteps of ConstitutionDAO, AssangeDAO collected ETH via JuiceBox and proportionally gave shares of a governance token, $JUSTICE. JuiceBox was used as a tried and tested platform for for pooling funds with large groups of people with a clear mission statement.
			</p>
			<p>
				$JUSTICE is the token that governs the AssangeDAO. Initially, as many other DAOs in the space, the DAO's governance mechanism will involve a <a href="https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x7BE99ca4E6893ef57cf349ab56307628100feA00/balances">Gnosis Safe multi-sig wallet</a> with trusted individuals in the crypto space as the initial signers (Amir Taaki, Rachel-Rose O'Leary, Fiskantes, McKenna, and Silke Noa). $JUSTICE holders can vote on governance proposals via a <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/assangedao.eth">snapshot governance page</a> which will dictate the future direction of the DAO. Additional Gnosis Safe governance modules may be added in due course. The Gnosis Safe multi-sig wallet address of AssangeDAO is 0x7BE99ca4E6893ef57cf349ab56307628100feA00.
				</p>
				<p>
Now that the Auction has been won by the DAO, the NFT is held on behalf of the $JUSTICE holders in a multi-sig. The community will decide via governance what to do with the NFT and the future roadmap of the DAO. 
</p>
				
		</div>

		<div class="col-md-6 text-left text-white">
			<h3 class="mb-4">How it works</h3>
			<p>We have prepared an initial governance model for the DAO, which is shown in the diagram above, and can be ratified by our first vote. First, community members will share a draft of the proposal in <a href="http://forum.assangedao.org/">the forum</a> for discussion with the community. This <a href="https://github.com/AssangeDAO/governance/blob/main/aip-0001.md">proposal template</a> should be used.</p>

			<p>Following community discussion, proposals are reviewed by the Consensus Unit. Their role is to screen the proposals for any potential harm to Assange or his legal case before a proposal is published on <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/assangedao.eth">snapshot</a>. If the Consensus Unit believes the proposal may cause harm to Assange or efforts to free Assange, they may reject the proposal from advancing. Initially, the Consensus Unit will consist of Jen Robinson (Julian Assange's lawyer), Gabriel Shipton (Julian Assange's brother) and Stella Moris (Julian Assange's fiancée) and our community moderators. </p>

			<p>If the proposal is accepted by the Consensus Unit, it will be added to <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/assangedao.eth">Snapshot</a>. $JUSTICE holders will be able to vote on accepting or rejecting the proposal.</p>

			<p>Where required, successful community proposals will be executed by the Justice Safe signers or self-execute via the Zodiac Reality module.</p>

			<h2 class="">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		
			<h3 class="mb-4">Who is Julian Assange?</h3>
				<p>
Julian Assange the founder of WikiLeaks, is a publisher and the world’s foremost freedom of speech campaigner.
Julian stands for informing the public about what their governments do in their name.
WikiLeaks publications have exposed war crimes and corruption and have been used as evidence in court cases around the world.
Since April 2019 Julian has been imprisoned in Belmarsh Prison in London, fighting extradition to the United States.
Assange faces a 175 year prison sentence if extradited to the US merely for receiving and publishing truthful information in the public interest. </p>

		<div class="col-md-6 text-left text-white">
			<h3 class="mb-4">What is AssangeDAO’s Mission?</h3>
			<p>
The primary mission of AssangeDAO is to Free Julian Assange. We are cypherpunks seeking to free Assange from the legacy justice system. </p>
<h3 class="mb-4">How will the DAO accomplish this?</h3>
			<p>The DAO has already helped raise funds for Julian Assange's legal defense. We plan on supporting and initiating more projects that directly or indirectly support Julian Assange and the causes he stands for such as Freedom of Information and Whistleblowing.  </p>
			<h3 class="mb-4 mt-4">Will more $JUSTICE tokens be minted?</h3>
			<p>No. It is not possible for AssangeDAO to mint more $JUSTICE tokens as the Juicebox Project NFT has been sent to a burn address. The total supply of $JUSTICE tokens is 17,346,149,507 minus any burned tokens. </p>
			<h3 class="mb-4 mt-4">What is the Multi-sig address?</h3>
			<p>The Multi-sig (Treasury) address of AssangeDAO is AssangeDAO.eth or <a href="https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x7BE99ca4E6893ef57cf349ab56307628100feA00/balances">0x7BE99ca4E6893ef57cf349ab56307628100feA00</a>.</p>
			<h3 class="mb-4 mt-4">How will the DAO raise funds?</h3>
			<p>The DAO will continue to partner with High-Profile individuals and Artists on upcoming NFT auctions to raise money directly for the DAO's treasury.</p>
			<h3 class="mb-4 mt-4">How can I donate to the DAO?</h3>
			<p>If you would like to Donate to the DAO, you may donate ETH or Ethereum based tokens to the DAO's treasury address listed above. You will not receive any $JUSTICE tokens for donations to the DAO.</p>
			<h3 class="mb-4 mt-4">Were the developers of the DAO paid?</h3>
			<p>No. Everyone who helped create and develop the DAO did so on volunteer basis. Nobody was paid and no tokens were reserved or paid to anyone. The DAO $JUSTICE governance tokens were issued entirely to the contributors at a ratio of 1,000,000 Justice tokens per 1 ETH.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6 text-left text-white">
			<h3 class="mb-4">What is a DAO?</h3>
			<p>A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an entity with no central leadership. Decisions get made from the bottom-up, governed by a community organized around a specific set of rules enforced on a blockchain. DAOs are internet-native organizations collectively owned and managed by their members. They have built-in treasuries that are only accessible with the approval of their members. Decisions are made via proposals the group votes on during a specified period.</p>
			<h3 class="mb-4 mt-4">What is the Governance Layer?</h3>
			<p>The AssangeDAO was constituted with the Assange Family being the DAO's governance layer. Stella Moris (Julian Assange's partner), Gabriel Shipton (Julian's brother), and Jennifer Robinson (Julian's Lawyer) are the 3 members of this unit. The Governance layer has the power to veto (reject) proposals that they determine could be harmful to Julian Assange or to his legal defense. The Assange Family is a great asset to us as they are the direct means of communicating with Assange. The Assange Family cannot control the DAO treasury or force proposals to be accepted. It is in place simply to ensure that a hostile entity cannot takeover the DAO and force harmful proposals to pass. The Assange Family involvement with the DAO also greatly boosts the DAO's credibility and publicity.</p>
			<h3 class="mb-4 mt-4">How can members submit proposals?</h3>
			<p>AssangeDAO token holders are invited to participate on the forum and draft proposals there. Once reviewed and discussed by the community, the Proposals can be submitted to Snapshot by the community elected snapshot authors (proposers) so the token holders can vote on them.</p>
			<h3 class="mb-4 mt-4">What will the AssangeDAO do when Assange is freed?</h3>
			<p>We will not stop our mission until Assange is free. Once Julian Assange is truly freed our mission will be complete.
			When we have succeeded in seeing Assange set free, the community will at that time discuss and vote on a new mission for the DAO.</p>
