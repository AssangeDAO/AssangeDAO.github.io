<h1>Background</h1>

<p>
The FreeAssangeDAO is dedicated to freeing Assange from the failing legacy justice system.
</p>
<p>
The DAO started to mobilize in a Telegram group on December 10th, 2021, the day that the U.S. government won its appeal of a British court ruling that barred Assange’s extradition to the US. Unless appealed successfully before the Supreme Court, this ruling will condemn Assange to up to 175 years in prison in US if found guilty of all charges.
</p>
<p>
Shortly after the Telegram group was formed, Assange’s brother Gabriel Shipton joined. He informed us that an NFT collaboration with Assange was in progress which was going to be auctioned to raise funds for his campaign.
</p>
<p>
Inspired by the FreeRossDAO, the FreeAssangeDAO intends to raise capital to bid on Assange's NFT which will be fractionalized among all members who donated. By galvanizing an Assange solidarity network we will to send a powerful signal that the time of passivity is over. A new era of cypherpunk squad organization has dawned.
</p>

<h1>How to help</h1>

<ol class="pl-3">
<li>
Donate ETH to FreeAssangeDAO. This will be used to bid on an NFT auctioned by the Assange family. (Do not send FreeAssangeDAO other assets. All other assets will be considered a donation to the DAO’s treasury— to be governed by FreeAssangeDAO — and are not eligible for pro-rata fractions or a refund.)
</li>
<li>
Have any ideas for what else we can do as a community to Free Assange? Share them in the <em>#ideas</em> channel.
</li>
<li>
Compete against the FreeAssangeDAO in bidding on the Assange NFT. We will be happy if we lose the auction since we know we have still succeeded in raising money for this cause.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>How it works</h1>

<p>
The DAO is fully community led. Contributors will receive $JUSTICE tokens in return for their contributions pro-rata. $JUSTICE is a governance token that allows holders to direct the FreeAssangeDAO. If the NFT auction is won by the DAO, the token will also represent fractionalised ownership rights of the Assange NFT. The DAO's governance mechanism will initialy consist of a Snapshot page for community voting and a Gnosis Safe multisignature wallet controlled by trusted community members. Additional governance modules will be added in due course.
</p>

<p>
First, community members will share a draft of the proposal in the forum for discussion with the community. <a href="https://github.com/FreeAssangeDAO/governance/blob/main/template/proposal.md">This proposal template</a> should be used.
</p>
<p>
Following community discussion, the proposal will be reviewed by the Consensus Unit. Their role is to screen the proposals for any potential harm to Assange or his legal case before a proposal is published on snapshot. If the Consensus Unit believes the proposal may cause harm to Assange or efforts to free Assange, they may reject the proposal from advancing. Initially, the Consensus Unit will consist of Jen Robinson, Gabriel Shipton and Stella Moris and our community moderators.
</p>
<p>
If the proposal is accepted by the Consensus Unit, it will be added to Snapshot. $JUSTICE holders will be able to vote on accepting or rejecting the proposal.
</p>
<p>
Where required, successful community proposals will be executed by the Justice Safe signers or self-execute via the Zodiac Reality module. The initial signers are Amir Taaki, Rachel-Rose O'Leary, Fiskantes, McKenna, and Silke Noa.
